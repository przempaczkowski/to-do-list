For a beginner who knows HTML and CSS and wants to practice using functions in JavaScript, it's a good idea to start with a project that gradually introduces JavaScript concepts while building something interactive and useful. Here's a beginner-friendly project idea:

Project: Interactive To-Do List

Project Description:
Create an interactive to-do list web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project will help you practice functions, event handling, DOM manipulation, and basic user interactions.

Project Features:

Add Tasks: Users should be able to add tasks to the to-do list.
Display Tasks: Display the list of tasks on the web page.
Mark Tasks as Done: Allow users to mark tasks as completed or done.
Delete Tasks: Provide an option to delete tasks from the list.
Clear All Tasks: Allow users to clear all tasks at once.
Task Count: Display the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks.
Local Storage: Optionally, you can store the tasks in the browser's local storage so that tasks persist even after the page is refreshed.
How to Approach It:

HTML: Start by creating the structure of your to-do list using HTML. Create input fields for adding tasks, a list to display tasks, and buttons for marking tasks as done and deleting them.

CSS: Apply CSS styles to make your to-do list visually appealing and user-friendly.

JavaScript Functions: Here's how you can structure your JavaScript functions:

Create a function to add tasks to the list.
Create a function to mark tasks as done or undone.
Create a function to delete tasks.
Create a function to clear all tasks.
Create a function to update the task count.
If you're using local storage, create functions to save and load tasks from local storage.
Event Listeners: Attach event listeners to HTML elements (e.g., buttons) to trigger these functions when users interact with your to-do list.

Testing: Test your to-do list thoroughly by adding, marking, deleting, and clearing tasks. Make sure the task count updates correctly.

Optional Enhancements: If you want to challenge yourself further, consider adding features like task priorities, due dates, or the ability to edit tasks.

This project will not only help you practice using functions in JavaScript but also improve your understanding of the DOM and event handling. Additionally, it's a practical project that you can use to manage your tasks or showcase as part of your portfolio.
